# User Story

A User can create Stores to sell their Indoor Plants to other users. Once a store has been set up, the user will have the ability to look at their store statistics, such as: income, amount of plants sold, and best-selling plant. The user will also have the option to buy plants from other stores by loading their account balance with cash. Once a plant is bought, that plant will be added to the user's plant collection.
